I'm currently studying Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, and this space is where I document my learning journey and showcase personal projects. Alongside my passion for security and digital investigation, I'm also deeply interested in creating software, applications, web pages, and exploring different types of app development.

I’m excited about building a community with shared interests — whether it's cybersecurity, coding, or creative tech projects. Feel free to connect, collaborate, or just start a conversation!
